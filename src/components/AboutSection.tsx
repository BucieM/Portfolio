              I'm an aspiring Quant with a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics, currently completing my BSc (Hons) in Mathematical Science at UWC. I have strong skills in financial modeling, statistical analysis, and computational mathematics, with hands-on experience in Python, MATLAB, R, Power BI, and more. I’ve worked on projects with NITheCS, CHPC, and UWC-CoLab (NEMISA), and I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with data. I'm open to work and ready to start immediately.
